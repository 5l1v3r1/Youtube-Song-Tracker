Youtube a playlist called "My Mix" which contains the music you listen too 
frequently. Since I use youtube as my main "music player" this program
attempts to emulate traditional music players like itunes via web automation of
youtube.


Currently this is only using my local firefox  profile and uses jsut a terminal
to go next song, replay song, go previous song, display current song.

Plans
1. make generic firefox and chrome profile for others to use
2. make this script executable with common linux status bars like polybar
